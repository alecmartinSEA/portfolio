		<p>A website done right starts with the user. There is a lot of work
			done before the website gets to the users screen. As a developer our job 
			should be bridging the gap between the designers and the users. 
			If we do our job correctly the user should have a good experience and 
			it will make them want to come back. My job will be to listen to the designers’
			ideas and see what I can bring to life.</p>
		<p>My name is Alec Martin. I am a web developer and an advocate for the user. 
			Using my skills, such as (xxxx), I facilitate the designers’ vision
			that will fit the users’ needs. In that situation everyone from the stakeholders, 
			to the users win. With my knowledge of web development as well as visual design that I
			learned at Seattle Central College, I will work with designers, stakeholders and 
			whoever else I may need to work with to solve your biggest challenges. I am actively
			learning what makes your users tick to create an effective holistic user experience for
			 the users on and off the screen.</p>
